It is similar to infatuation except that it lingers, is usually less lusty and does not have the same negative connotation. Also is usually a temporary state, unlike love. Often thoughts of the person are deep and engaging, resulting in day dreaming. The word was originally founded by a Psychologist in the 1970s ']
